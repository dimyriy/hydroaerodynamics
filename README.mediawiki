'''Solver case for multiregion conjugate heat transfer analysis of flows with disperse phase coupling'''<br/>
This case should be run by the last version of '''parcelIterativeFoam''' solver, which can be found here:<br/>
https://github.com/dimyriy/parcelIterativeFoam<br/>
and new '''kOmegaSST''' model with curvature correction, which can be found here<br/>
https://github.com/dimyriy/kOmegaCC<br/>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
'''''./ChangeDict''''' - remove decomposition Data and change boundary conditions according to changeDictionary files for each region<br/>
'''''./Clean''''' - remove all solution data<br/>
'''''./CompletelyClean''''' - remove all solution, decomposition and polyMesh data. (You have to run '''''RunCase''''' script after doing that)<br/>
'''''./RunCase''''' - convert your ''.msh'' file ''(Note that it is important to have only one .msh file in this directory)'' to OpenFoam format and split mesh to a regions for multiregion running<br/>
'''''./Run''''' - decompose case and run parcelIterativeFoam in parallel<br/>
<br/>

If you want to share your own solution of that case, you have to correct ''.gitignore'' file.
