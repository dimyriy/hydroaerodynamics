This case should be run by the last version of parcelIterativeFoam solver, which can be found here:
https://github.com/dimyriy/parcelIterativeFoam
and new kOmegaSST model with curvature correction, which can be found here
https://github.com/dimyriy/kOmegaCC

./ChangeDict - remove decomposition Data and change boundary conditions according to changeDictionary files for each region.
./Clean - remove all solution data
./CompletelyClean - remove all solution, decomposition and polyMesh data. (You have run RunCase script after doing that)
./RunCase - convert your .msh file (it's important to have only one .msh file in this directory) to OpenFoam format and split mesh to a regions for multiregion running.
./Run - decompose case and run parcelIterativeFoam in parallel.
If you want to share your own solution of that case, you have to correct .gitignore file.
