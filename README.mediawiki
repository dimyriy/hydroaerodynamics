== Solver case for multiregion conjugate heat transfer analysis of flows with disperse phase coupling  ==
This case should be run by the last version of '''parcelIterativeFoam''' solver, which can be found here:
<br/>
https://github.com/dimyriy/parcelIterativeFoam
<br/>
and new '''kOmegaSST''' model with curvature correction, which can be found here

'''''./ChangeDict''''' - remove decomposition Data and change boundary conditions according to changeDictionary files for each region.
'''''./Clean''''' - remove all solution data
'''''./CompletelyClean''''' - remove all solution, decomposition and polyMesh data. (You have run RunCase script after doing that)
'''''./RunCase''''' - convert your .msh file (it's important to have only one .msh file in this directory) to OpenFoam format and split mesh to a regions for multiregion running.
'''''./Run''''' - decompose case and run parcelIterativeFoam in parallel.

If you want to share your own solution of that case, you have to correct ''.gitignore'' file.
